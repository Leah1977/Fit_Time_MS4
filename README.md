A data-centric e-commerce web application.  I created this app promote fitness.  Each user can register and log in to create a profile.  Users will be able to shop online for a range of items.  There will be an option to add, edit or delete
items from a shopping bag.

Users can also sign up for classes and purchase online sessions.

There is also an admin user.  The admin user will have the permission required to create a new category.
  
### What value does it provide to its users.

This app allows users to shop online for a range of sports clothes and equipment.
It allows users to sign up and create a personal profile page.
Users can sign up and pay for online classes.

### What value does it provide to the site owner.

This web application will provide the site owner with a valuable database of sports items to sell on-line.

This app is aimed at anyone want to make time for themselves for overall health and fitness.
